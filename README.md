# normPredict
Surface normal prediction from single color image with a binary mask.
Master branch contains a Tensorflow implementation based on [ Common Multi-Scale Convolutional Architecture
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4734v4.pdf).
Hourglass branch contains a Tensorflow implementation based on [Stacked Hourglass model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06937.pdf).
